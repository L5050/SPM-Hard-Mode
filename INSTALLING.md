# INSTALLING
This tutorial assumes you already have your game visible in dolphin
* Download the latest release of the mod as a zip file from [here](https://github.com/L5050/SPM-Hard-Mode/releases)
* Enable cheats, then right click on your game in dolphin
* Go to `Properties > Gecko Codes > Add New Code`
* Set the name to "Hard Mode" and paste the code from the gecko.txt file from the zip file you downloaded, and click save
* Add another code, this time name it "Rel Loader" and paste the code from the rel loader.txt file from the zip folder
* Make sure that both codes have the little box next to them checked, click the boxes if they aren't
* Follow [this guide](https://github.com/SeekyCt/spm-rel-loader/blob/master/ISO.md) to patch your ISO or WBFS with the rel from the zip file
* Open your game with dolphin. If everything has worked properly then it will say "SPM Hard Mode" on the title screen
