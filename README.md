# SPM-Hard-Mode
Rel mod and gecko code for my SPM Hard Mode mod. Full releases available for US0, US2, JP0, and PAL versions of SPM

# Contents
* Gecko code that gets rid of most effects that double your damage, including bowser and items like the Mighty Tonic
* Rel mod that Makes bosses significantly harder, and makes it twice as hard to level up

# Known Bugs
* King Croacus skips to phase two of the battle on first hit instead of tanking some damage before going to phase two
* Count Bleck's black holes can be reflected with barry for some reason

# Credit
