# SPM-Hard-Mode
Rel mod and gecko code for my SPM Hard Mode mod. No full release yet, but coming soon

# Contents
* Gecko code that gets rid of most effects that double your damage, including bowser and items like the Mighty Tonic
* Rel mod that Makes bosses significantly harder, and makes it twice as hard to level up

# Known Bugs
* Some bosses, like Mr.L, O'Cabbage, and final O'Chunks do not receive the megabite attribute properly, so their HP has been increased instead
* King Croacus skips to phase two of the battle on first hit instead of tanking some damage before going to phase two

# Credit
* SeekyCT for the rel mod loader, various functions, and the code documentation for SPM

- [X] Reduce all bosses health while increasing their defense so that you only deal one damage per hit
