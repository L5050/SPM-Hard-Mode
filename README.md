# SPM-Hard-Mode
Rel mod and gecko code for my SPM Hard Mode mod. Full releases available for US0, US2, JP0, and PAL versions of SPM

# Contents
* Gecko code that gets rid of most effects that double your damage, including Bowser and items like the Bone-In-Cut
* Rel mod that Makes bosses significantly harder, and makes it twice as hard to level up, as well as adding more ways to get Merlee's charms and listing the amount of charms you have on the screen

# Known Bugs
* King Croacus skips to phase two of the battle on first hit instead of tanking some damage before going to phase two
* Count Bleck's black holes can be reflected with barry for some reason
