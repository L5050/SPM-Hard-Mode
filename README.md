# SPM-Hard-Mode
Rel mod and for my Super Paper Mario Hard Mode mod. Full releases available for US0, US2, JP0, and PAL versions of SPM

# Contents
* Rel mod that Makes bosses significantly harder, and makes it twice as hard to level up, as well as adding more ways to get Merlee's charms and listing the amount of charms you have on the screen. Also gets rid of most effects that double your damage, including Bowser and items like the Bone-In-Cut

# Known Bugs
* Sometimes using an item will reduce charm count for no reason
