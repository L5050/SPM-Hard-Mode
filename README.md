# SPM-Hard-Mode
Rel mod and for my Super Paper Mario Hard Mode mod.

# Contents (HardModeJr)
* Rel mod that Makes bosses significantly harder, and makes it twice as hard to level up, as well as adding more ways to get Merlee's charms and listing the amount of charms you have on the screen. Also gets rid of most effects that double your damage, including Bowser and items like the Bone-In-Cut. Boss AI stays the same as vanilla for the most part, and there aren't too many drastic changes.

# Contents (Hard Mode: Rubies and Magic)
* Everything from HardModeJr but heavily ramped up. Lots of boss fights have much more difficult and complex AI, the postgame challenges are completely reworked, and 
has a lot more balance changes than HardModeJr as well as much more willing to deviate from vanilla. Significantly more difficult difficulty curve compared to HardModeJr

# Known Bugs (Rubies and Magic)
* The boomer upgrade does not increase visual blast radius in the Flopside pit on US2
* Dimentio softlock in chapter 5
* Mimi crashing in 2-4
