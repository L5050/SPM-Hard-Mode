# SPM-Hard-Mode
Rel mod and gecko code for my SPM Hard Mode mod. No full release yet, but coming soon

# Contents
* Gecko code that gets rid of most effects that double your damage, including bowser and items like the Mighty Tonic
* Rel mod that Makes bosses significantly harder, and makes it twice as hard to level up

# Credit
* SeekyCT for the rel mod loader, various functions, and the code documentation for SPM
